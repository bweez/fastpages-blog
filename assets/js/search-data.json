            "content": "Your Deep Learning Journey . This is my third time restarting this course. I have been struggling to find a way to force myself to stick to it. I am finally heeding the advice in Lesson 3 and starting to try to write a blog about it. This is a topic that I find deeply fascinating. If you are interested in Machine Learning I highly recommend checking it out for yourself. A note on format for this blog. My plan is to go through each chapter of the book and write a blog post on it using the Jupyter Notebook defined for it. . As discussed in the first lesson this book is written with Jupyter Notebooks. All of the chapters can be found in this github repo. I am using the &quot;clean&quot; version which just leaves the headers within the chapters. I will fill in each one with ideas I find interesting or examples of what I learned from it. . Deep Learning Is for Everyone . &quot;You don&#39;t need lots of math, data or expensive computers.&quot; . There are a lot of tools that abstact the need to do a lot of complicated statistics that machine learning is built on. We can leverage those tools to build models that learn how to solve problems at or even above an average human level. . &quot;We&#39;ve seen record-braking reults with &lt;50 items of data&quot; . This isn&#39;t sourced in the book, but I think it may be demonstrated later. . &quot;You don&#39;t need expensive computers.&quot; . I was able to setup an account on PaperSpace and run a free GPU to run this notebook. . In the book they also list example use cases for all kinds of professions from Medicine to Playing games. . Neural Networks: A Brief History . Briefly touches on the initial concecption of a Neural Net in 1943 by Warren McCulloch. Also references a very influential book Perceptrons writen by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert. The most pivotal work by David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the Parallel Distributed Processing PDP Research Group in 1986. . Who We Are . Explains who Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger are and what their motivations for creating the book were. . How to Learn Deep Learning . &quot;The basic idea is to teach the whole game. That means that if you’re teaching baseball, you first take people to a baseball game or get them to play it. You don’t teach them how to wind twine to make a baseball from scratch, the physics of a parabola, or the coefficient of friction of a ball on a bat.&quot; - David Perkins from Making Learning Whole. . This is probably my favorite metaphor in the book. It is applicable to so much more than just machine learning. . Teaching the whole game . | Always teaching through examples . | Simplifying as much as possible . | Removing barriers . | . Your Projects and Your Mindset . Playful and curious. . The Software: PyTorch, fastai, and Jupyter (And Why It Doesn&#39;t Matter) . These are just easiest they have found to use and they are free. . Your First Model . &quot;It is crucial that you run your own experiments in parallel with this book in order to learn.&quot; - Sylvain . They cover basic setup of a GPU Deep Learning Server. Why you should avoid buying your own. It is definately doable, but it is &quot;distracting.&quot; To continue the baseball methaphor I think this would fall under building the baseball rather than playing the game. . They also cover what a GPU is and why it is better than a CPU at the math the models will use to do the learning. . Getting a GPU Deep Learning Server . The list of recommended servers is on the book&#39;s website under &quot;Notebook Servers.&quot; The three they have listed currently are Google&#39;s Colab, Gradient PaperSpace, and AWS Sagemaker. . Running Your First Notebook . Below is the actual Python code needed to build our first model. I added some comments to disambiguate what each piece is doing. . # Importing the fastai lib, Jeremy covers why they use import * in the lesson from fastai.vision.all import * # This is where all the images of pets are stored path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/&#39;images&#39; # A simple function to check if an image is a Cat. This particular data set is label by using an uppercase letter for an image of cat. def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper() # This is organizing the data and loading it into memory on the GPU. &quot;valid_pct&quot; is telling the function to reserve 20% of the images for learning validation. &quot;item_tfms&quot; is resizing all of the images to be the same size to keep the input consistent. dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func( path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42, label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224)) # &quot;cnn_learner&quot; is our learning function it is using a convolutional neural networks (cnn) with a resnet34 architecture. The error_rate is how accurate the model is at predicting whether or not the image is a cat. learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate) # This fine tunes the model # &quot;This is the key to deep learning — determining how to fit the parameters of a model to get it to solve your problem. To fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of epochs). The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model. If you select a number that is too small, you can always train for more epochs later.&quot; learn.fine_tune(1) . Sidebar: This Book Was Written in Jupyter Notebooks . Brief sidebar on what Jupyter Notebooks are. It is an interactive python REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) with markdown support. . End sidebar . The stuff below can only be run on a running notebook. . uploader = widgets.FileUpload() uploader . img = PILImage.create(uploader.data[0]) is_cat,_,probs = learn.predict(img) print(f&quot;Is this a cat?: {is_cat}.&quot;) print(f&quot;Probability it&#39;s a cat: {probs[1].item():.6f}&quot;) . What Is Machine Learning? . &quot;Arthur Samuel started working on a different way to get computers to complete tasks, which he called machine learning. In his classic 1962 essay “Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation,” he wrote: Programming a computer for such computations is, at best, a difficult task, not primarily because of any inherent complexity in the computer itself but, rather, because of the need to spell out every minute step of the process in the most exasperating detail. Computers, as any programmer will tell you, are giant morons, not giant brains. . Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance. We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would “learn” from its experience. . There are a number of powerful concepts embedded in this short statement: . The idea of a “weight assignment” | The fact that every weight assignment has some “actual performance” | The requirement that there be an “automatic means” of testing that performance | The need for a “mechanism” (i.e., another automatic process) for improving the performance by changing the weight assignments&quot; | . What Is a Neural Network? . &quot;What we would like is some kind of function that is so flexible that it could be used to solve any given problem, just by varying its weights. ... But what about that process? One could imagine that you might need to find a new “mechanism” for automatically updating weight for every problem. This would be laborious. What we’d like here as well is a completely general way to update the weights of a neural network, to make it improve at any given task. Conveniently, this also exists! . This is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD).&quot; . This is the mathmatical underpinning of how ML works. . A Bit of Deep Learning Jargon . The functional form of the model is called its architecture (but be careful — sometimes people use model as a synonym of architecture, so this can get confusing). | The weights are called parameters. | The predictions are calculated from the independent variable, which is the data not including the labels. | The results of the model are called predictions. | The measure of performance is called the loss. | The loss depends not only on the predictions, but also on the correct labels (also known as targets or the dependent variable); e.g., “dog” or “cat.” | . Limitations Inherent To Machine Learning . This is left in the clean version of the book on the fastbook repo. I think it is important to leave it here as well. . From this picture we can now see some fundamental things about training a deep learning model: . A model cannot be created without data. | A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it. | This learning approach only creates predictions, not recommended actions. | It&#39;s not enough to just have examples of input data; we need labels for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren&#39;t enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats). | . Generally speaking, we&#39;ve seen that most organizations that say they don&#39;t have enough data, actually mean they don&#39;t have enough labeled data. If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they&#39;ve been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We&#39;ll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it&#39;s such an important issue in practice. . Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make predictions (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you&#39;ll learn how to create a recommendation system that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (inputs) and what they went on to buy or look at (labels), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That&#39;s very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you&#39;ve never heard of before. . How Our Image Recognizer Works . Does essentailly what I did with the code comments in the Running Your First Notebook section, but with a bit more detail. They touch on the idea of &quot;Overfitting&quot; a model to the data. If a model is overfit to the data it will give bad predictions on new data. . What Our Image Recognizer Learned . Image Recognizers Can Tackle Non-Image Tasks . Jargon Recap . Deep Learning Is Not Just for Image Classification . path = untar_data(URLs.CAMVID_TINY) dls = SegmentationDataLoaders.from_label_func( path, bs=8, fnames = get_image_files(path/&quot;images&quot;), label_func = lambda o: path/&#39;labels&#39;/f&#39;{o.stem}_P{o.suffix}&#39;, codes = np.loadtxt(path/&#39;codes.txt&#39;, dtype=str) ) learn = unet_learner(dls, resnet34) learn.fine_tune(8) . learn.show_results(max_n=6, figsize=(7,8)) . from fastai.text.all import * dls = TextDataLoaders.from_folder(untar_data(URLs.IMDB), valid=&#39;test&#39;) learn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy) learn.fine_tune(4, 1e-2) . If you hit a &quot;CUDA out of memory error&quot; after running this cell, click on the menu Kernel, then restart. Instead of executing the cell above, copy and paste the following code in it: . from fastai.text.all import * dls = TextDataLoaders.from_folder(untar_data(URLs.IMDB), valid=&#39;test&#39;, bs=32) learn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy) learn.fine_tune(4, 1e-2) . This reduces the batch size to 32 (we will explain this later). If you keep hitting the same error, change 32 to 16. . learn.predict(&quot;I really liked that movie!&quot;) .

It can be hard to know in pages and pages of prose what the key things are that you really need to focus on and remember. So, we&#39;ve prepared a list of questions and suggested steps to complete at the end of each chapter. All the answers are in the text of the chapter, so if you&#39;re not sure about anything here, reread that part of the text and make sure you understand it. Answers to all these questions are also available on the book&#39;s website. You can also visit the forums if you get stuck to get help from other folks studying this material. .
